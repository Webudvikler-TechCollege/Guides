                <p>
                  After the design sprint your group will have some items in the backlog
                  but during the project you will probably find more things that need to
                  be added to the backlog. You could add these tasks during or after the daily
                  standup or at any other time, just make sure your whole group knows about it

                <p>
                  Before each "sprint" the group decides what tasks you are going to work on for that "sprint".
                  When you have decided what tasks you are going to work on, drag them to the "Ready" column.

              <p>
                If the item is something that needs to be coded, you need to convert it to an issue so that it
                can be marked in a pull request.

              <p>
                Some projects might have two repositories (one for the back-end and another for the front-end) and in that case you 
                assign the issue to the correct repository. If you only have one repository you just assign all the issues to that repository.

                When you create the issue you might already know who is going to work on it, if that is the case
                you can assign the issue to that person. If you don't know yet who is going to work on it you can skip this step
